# Duplicant

Duplicant is a bare-bones generator script for creating a React-powered <abbr title="Single Page App">SPA</abbr> hosted by a simple Express server. This new project includes the conveniences of contemporary JavaScript, code splitting, and hot module reloading (for both the client and server).

> In JavaScript, no one can hear `this` scream...

### Installation

```shell
npm install -g duplicant
```

### Getting started

```shell
duplicant my-project
cd my-project
npm start
```

You are now ready to start building with:

* `react`
* `react-dom`
* `react-router-dom`
* `styled-components`

Some key things to review before you get too far down the rabbit hole:

* `client/chunks.js` will show you how to create a code-split component
* `client/routes.js` will show you how these "chunked" components are used

#### Time to get shit done!!
